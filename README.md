This assignment has us refactor our marketing agency's codebase to be more organized, appealing, and optimized for search engines while following current accessibility standards.

The source code in both the HTML and CSS has been updated with semantic HTML elements to better separate the page's content. The HTML elements now follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. The image elements now have accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes now fall in sequential order. The title element has been updated with a concise, descriptive title. The CSS has been updated to consolidate repeating rules that can be applied to multiple elements on the webpage. Comments have also been added for each change made to the original code accompanied with a reason. Comments have also been added to the HTML to notate the different sections.
